**Disclaimer**: This is my way of working. Please feel free to fork this tutorial for your purposes but keep in mind that this is my setup I share with you. I am open for suggestions using the issues section but only in matter of Documentation improvements and Fixes of wrong commands. Thank you and I hope this guide will inspire your workflow :-)
